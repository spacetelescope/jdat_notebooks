    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses time series JWST NIRSpec data taken during a ground-based campaign to illustrate extracting exoplanet spectra from time-series observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data are derived from the ISIM-CV3, the cryovacuum campaign of the JWST Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), that took place at Goddard Space Flight Center during the winter 2015-2016 (Kimble et al. 2016). The data can be found at https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst-nirspec/test-data, and detailed and insightful report of the data by G. Giardino, S. Birkmann, P. Ferruit, B. Dorner, B. Rauscher can be found here: ftp://ftp.cosmos.esa.int/jwstlib/ReleasedCV3dataTimeSeries/CV3_TimeSeries_PRM.tgz\n",

    "exoplanet grid was selected (clear atmosphere at solar metallicity).  With an actual NIRSpec dataset, the noise properties of the detector, jitter, and the effects on extracting exoplanet spectra from time-series observations can more accurately simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly the aim of this notebook is to work with these time series observations to:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) Extract 1D spectra from the 2D spectral images. \n",
    "    \n",
    " 2) Define a time series model to fit to the wavelength dependent transit light curve.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3) Fit each time series wavelength bin of the 1D spectra, measuring the desired quantity $R_{pl}(\\lambda)/R_{star}$.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4) Produce a measured transmission spectrum that can then be compared to models.\n",
    " \n",
    "The example outputs the fit light curves for each spectral bin, along with fitting statistics.\n",

    "The CV3 test assessed the stability of the instrument by introducing a large spatial jitter and drift. This resulted in a significant X,Y movement of the spectra on the 2D detector. While this bulk shift has been removed which aligns the spectra, intra- and inter- pixel sensitivities introduce flux variations which need to be removed. The jitter from the CV3 test was more than 30 mas, which is ~4X larger than the JWST stability requirement. Thus, in orbit these detector effects are expected to be significantly smaller, but they will still be present and will need to be modeled and removed from time series observations.\n",

    "The detector X, Y positions here were measured from cross-correlation of the 2D images (collapsing the spectra along one dimension first), and are saved in arrays $shx$ and $shy$. These detending vectors would ideally be measured using the trace position values from the spectral extraction of each integration, as that could also accurately measure integration-to-integration how the spectra spatially changed on the detector.\n",

    "The precisions from the ground-based test are very encouraging, with the best measured bin (which occurs in a clean part of the spectrum with high count rates) achieving near-photon limited transit depths measured to about 30 ppm in only 2 hours of data, and with minimal time correlated noise ($\\sigma_r$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more robust error estimates, in practice the least-squares minimization performed here would be replaced by an MCMC routine.  In addition, with actual transit data, the transit fit parameters (e.g. $i$, $a/R_{star}$, T$_0$) would also have to be first fit as well, as they can/will differ from literature estimates in high precision transit light curves as JWST will provide.\n"
