    "MAST (Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes) provides a means of retrieving data through a variety of methods. The [MAST Portal](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Portal+Guide) allows users to interactively search for particular observations and filter by keywords. An in-depth [tutorial](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Portal+Guide) is available to aid users in accessing MAST in this manner. In some scenarios, particularly with large queries, it may be more efficient to use [Astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html). Some broad capabilities including positional queries, metadata queries, and catalog queries are described in the documentation. General documentation on the [MAST API](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/) is also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason why users may want to search the archive is to find potential duplicatation observations for their proposals. As described in the [JWST Duplicate Observations Policy](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-general-science-policies/jwst-duplicate-observations-policy), an observation may be a duplication of another observation if it observes the same astronomical source or field with the same instrument as well as similar sensitivity and spectral range. More instrument-specific details can be found in the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following topics are covered in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How to submit a NIRSpec MAST Query using python\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How to perform a broad search for all NIRSpec Data\n",
    "    - How to perform a search using one query filter parameter\n",
    "    - How to perform a search using multiple query filter parameters\n",
    "    - Information on available search parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How to perform checks for potential duplication issues with any given targets by comparing with pre-existing MAST Data (NOTE: This may not include scheduled observations, and results should be confirmed in APT)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Define an input catalog describing a potential observation\n",
    "    - Query MAST within a search radius for observations with overlapping wavelengths and similar exposure times\n",
    "    - Examine potential for duplicate observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this notebook is designed for NIRSpec users, other JWST instruments follow similar structures for MAST queries. More information that may be relevant to additional instruments can be found on the [Astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) web page. "
