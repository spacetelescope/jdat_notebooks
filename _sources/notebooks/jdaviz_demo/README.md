# Jdaviz Tutorials

This repository hosts material used for Jdaviz tutorials. The demos
showcase how to use Jdaviz to visualize and manipulate images, 2D spectra,
1D spectra, and data cubes.

Please read the installation instructions in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz_demo/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
and set up your machine. Do not forget to download the necessary datasets.
Some files are quite large. You can also try adapting the material to use
your own datasets.

If you have questions, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz_demo/issues)
in this repository or email Cami at cpacifici@stsci.edu.

Additional documentation can be found on the [Jdaviz readthedocs](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
