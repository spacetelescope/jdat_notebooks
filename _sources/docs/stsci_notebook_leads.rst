Notebook Draft
**************

Start writing your notebook and think through the following.  Contact Cami or Ori along the way to ask questions.  We don't expect you to perfectly integrate all tools on your own.

- **Manage your time**.  Consider you will likely need to spend 50% of your time writing your notebook draft, and 50% in the Sprint and Review stage.  A realistic rough estimate is 30 hours total, so 15 hours at each phase. 

- Download the notebook template and make sure to document your work as much as possible.  It is important to communicate the purpose of your notebook and where you obtained your data, as well as the algorithms you use to do the science.

    - Where did you get your data?
    - What is the scientific purpose of the notebook?
    - Which tools/packages do you use?

- We prefer you use JWST simulated data, but we realize this is not always possible.  Please communicate with Cami and Ori in advance about where you will obtain your data.
- Does my desired functionality exist in astropy and, specifically, specutils, photutils, and the visualization tools?

    - If so, am I using it?  Am I using it correctly?
    - If not, what needs to be done to enable it?  Make a developer note inside your cell.

- Make sure parts of your code are devoted to science validation.
- Break the notebook down into many, focused cells.  Follow the notebook style guide.
- Consider making your science as generalized as possible.
- If you get stuck, contact anyone above (step e) or use #jdadf_dev channel on slack.
- Upload your notebook on jdat_notebooks as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.

Join a Sprint
*************

When you have completed your notebook draft, you are ready to join a developer sprint.  

- Contact either Cami or Ori to sign up for a 2-week long sprint when you can devote time to developing your notebook.  You will be invited to a number of different meetings throughout a 2 week period.
- Attend an Orientation Meeting the week before your Sprint is set to begin, including a live technical review to understand the process.
- Prepare by bringing a list of developer notes and/or personal notes where you think your notebook could be improved with new functionality built into the tools.
- Attend the kick-off meeting (usually Monday 2pm) where you will meet the team, learn about the Product Owners (POs), and be assigned a scientific reviewer and a technical reviewer (this part can also happen offline).  
- Schedule a meeting with your technical reviewer.mFocus on utilizing the correct libraries and functionality.  Learn to turn your notes into Jira tickets and GitHub issues, as well as the process for having those tickets implemented and integrated back into your notebooks.
- Attend a couple tag-ups each week, which happen every morning at 10.30am via bluejeans;  this will provide you with an opportunity to focus on development of individual cells within a notebook
- Attend the Viz Tool hack hour (typically the second Monday of the sprint at 11am) to focus on notebook workflow using the Viz Tools
- If you get stuck, contact anyone above (step e) or use #jdadf_dev channel on slack.
- Make sure parts of your code are devoted to science validation.
- Attend the Review meeting (usually at the end of the sprint on Monday at 1:30pm) and show your notebook (this is also an opportunity to give feedback on the process).
