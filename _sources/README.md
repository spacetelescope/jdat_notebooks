# James Webb Space Telescope Data Analysis Tool Notebooks


The ``jdat_notebooks`` repository contains notebooks illustrating workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. Some of the notebooks also illustrate generic analysis workflows that are applicable to data from other observatories as well. This repository and the notebooks are one component of STScI's larger [Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).

## Summary and Description

The following [page](https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/) summarizes the material currently available.

## Installation

To download and execute the notebooks, please read the [detailed instructions](https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/install.html).

## Help

If you uncover any issues or bugs, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/issues/new).  For faster responses, however, we encourage you to submit a JWST Help Desk Ticket: jwsthelp.stsci.edu

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from both the scientist and developer community.  If you wish to contribute fixes or clarifications to existing notebooks, feel free to do so directly to this repository.  If you wish to contribute new notebooks or major reworks of existing notebooks, see the [contributing instructions](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst) or the documentation in the [Development section of the instructions](https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/docs/submitting_notebooks.html).

The notebooks attempt to utilize a number of software packages supported by STScI, including [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org), [glue](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/stable/index.html), [ginga](https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io), [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [astroimtools](http://astroimtools.readthedocs.io), [imexam](http://imexam.readthedocs.io), [jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [asdf](http://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [gwcs](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [synphot](http://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  Note jdaviz is STScI's JWST Data Analysis Visualization Tool, designed to be used with spectra, IFU cubes, and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS).
