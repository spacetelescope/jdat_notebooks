## Workflow to run when there is a direct push to the main branch, or a PR is submitted.
## The workflow runs three workflows - Valdation, Execution, and HTML Deployment.
## The jobs are dependent on the previous succeding - if valdiation fails, the rest will, if 
## execution fails, html deployment will not run.
## Each job runs on its own runner with an independent environment, with the exception of the 
## HTML generation, which occurs on a single runner using the global environment.
