    "## Introduction\n",
    "Extract 1D spectra from a 2D MIRI LRS spectral observation (single image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal is to provide the ability to extract spectra with different locations, extraction apertures, and techniques than are done in the JWST pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpliest spectral extraction is \"boxcar\" where all the pixels within some fixed width centered on the source position are summed at each wavelength.  Background subtraction can be done using regions offset from the source center.\n",
    "\n",
    "For spectra taken with a diffraction limited telescope like JWST, a modification boxcar extraction is to vary the extraction width linearly with wavelength.  Such a scaled boxcar extraction keeps the fraction of the source flux within the extraction region approximately constant with wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "For point sources, a PSF-weighted spectral extraction can be done.  Using the PSF to weight the extraction uses the actual PSF as a function of wavelength to optimize the extraction to the pixels with the greatest signal.  PSF-weighted extractions show the largest differences with boxcar extractions at lower S/N values."
