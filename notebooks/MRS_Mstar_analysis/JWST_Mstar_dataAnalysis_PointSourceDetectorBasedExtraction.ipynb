    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes one star represented by a dusty SED corresponding to the ISO SWS spectrum of W Per from Kraemer et al. (2002) and Sloan et al. (2003) to cover the MRS spectral range 5-28 microns.  Analysis of JWST spectral cubes requires extracting spatial-spectral features of interest and measuring their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first notebook, which will process the data and automatically detect and extract spectra for the point source.  The workflow automatically detects sources on the detector image plane to extract the spectrum of the point source. Then it will read in the spectra generated at Stage 3 of the JWST pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation to the Detector Based Extraction Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, one-dimensional spectra produced by the JWST pipeline are\n",
    "constructed exclusively from the combined and rectified 3-dimensional\n",
    "data cubes.  These data cubes are treated as a collection of images at\n",
    "various wavelength planes, and simple aperture-based (or effective\n",
    "PSF-weighted) techniques are used to recover the source intensity as a\n",
    "function of wavelength in a manner akin to standard imaging PSF\n",
    "photometry.  However, this method of extracting point source spectra\n",
    "from data cubes is not ideal; fundamentally, a source with no spatial\n",
    "structure should not undergo spatial reprocessing prior to extraction of\n",
    "spectral information.  Indeed, large-scale IFU surveys targeting point\n",
    "sources rather than extended sources (e.g., SDSS IV/MaStar, R. Yan et\n",
    "al. 2019) have relied on detector-based spectral extraction rather than\n",
    "the construction of 3d data cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the MIRI MRS in particular, such detector-based extraction offers\n",
    "the opportunity to correct for the following effects which would be\n",
    "difficult or impossible to handle once the observational data has been\n",
    "rectified into 3-dimensional cubes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Given the significant undersampling of the MRS, offsets in spaxel\n",
    "sampling locations as a function of wavelength can alias spatial\n",
    "structure from the point spread function into spectral artifacts that\n",
    "bias extracted 1D spectra.  3D cube building is designed in a manner to\n",
    "mitigate these artifacts, but the act of resampling ensures that 1D\n",
    "spectra of unresolved sources extracted from 3D cubes can never be as\n",
    "reliable as 1D spectra extracted directly from detector-level data\n",
    "without the intermediate resampling step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Resampled pixels in the data cubes have significant covariance with\n",
    "adjacent/nearby pixels.  Treating this covariance properly in the\n",
    "construction of extracted 1D spectra with flux and variance information\n",
    "is challenging, and not handled at present by the cube-based spectral\n",
    "extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Pipeline calibrations of the instrument throughput and wavelength\n",
    "calibration are based on sources that fill a given IFU slice, whereas\n",
    "point sources produce a non-uniform response depending upon the location\n",
    "of the source centroid within a given IFU slice.  For instance, given\n",
    "the degeneracy on the detector between the spatial across-slice and\n",
    "spectral dispersion directions, the wavelength solution for point\n",
    "sources will differ slightly than for extended sources in a manner that\n",
    "depends on the source location within the slice.  This effect cannot be\n",
    "recovered once a 3D cube has been constructed that combines data from\n",
    "many slices (and indeed, multiple dithered exposures).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The MRS has a spectral leak in which 2nd order light from 6 microns\n",
    "(Ch1B) is visible at a few percent transmission in the 12 micron\n",
    "observations (Ch3A).  This effect is not possible to correct in general,\n",
    "since the Ch3A field of view is larger than that of Ch1B.  However, for\n",
    "the specific case of a point source within the common field of view of\n",
    "all channels it is possible to use the Ch1B spectrum to predict and\n",
    "subtract the second-order signal from the Ch3A data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a method for achieving MIRI MRS\n",
    "detector-based point source extraction. The formalism behind the method\n",
    "follows the optimal spectral extraction formalism by Keith Horne 1986.\n",
    "Extracting a 1d integrated spectrum directly from the MRS detectors\n",
    "depends on (a) a detailed knowledge of the detector PSF, and (b) the\n",
    "pixel variance. The MRS detector PSF differs considerably from the\n",
    "telescope PSF due to the scattering of the photons inside the detector\n",
    "substrate. How well the detector PSF is understood/modeled/measured is\n",
    "key in this instance and should not be understated. For the pixel\n",
    "variance, the slope-fitting uncertainty from the pixel integration\n",
    "ramp(s) is used. The combination of the detector PSF and pixel variance\n",
    "is used as a weighing function to weigh the signal in each detector pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, the notebook code assumes that there is only one\n",
    "point source in the MRS field of view. Using a Gaussian-fitting routine\n",
    "at detector-level, the centroid of the point source is determined with a\n",
    "sub-pixel accuracy. The centroid is used to project the known detector\n",
    "PSF model directly onto the point source signal. The centroid is also\n",
    "used to derive the throughput and wavelength correction due to the\n",
    "location of the point source with respect to the imaging slicer of the\n",
    "MRS. The throughput and wavelength correction are applied before the\n",
    "spectral extraction step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral extraction step integrates the point source flux in a\n",
    "pre-defined list of wavelength bins. All detector pixels contributing to\n",
    "a wavelength bin are weighed by the projected PSF model -and- the pixel\n",
    "variance. In case the extracted spectral band is MRS band 3A (around 12\n",
    "microns) then the following steps are taken:\n",
    "- The band 1B (~6 micron) detector image is multiplied by a spectral\n",
    "leak transmission curve.\n",
    "- A 1d “spectral leak” integrated point source spectrum is extracted\n",
    "from band 1B.\n",
    "- The spectral leak spectrum is subtracted from the band 3A integrated\n",
    "point source spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements to the code will allow users to input MRS point\n",
    "source centroid locations to address the case of crowded fields, barely\n",
    "resolved blended point sources, and point sources located within a\n",
    "semi-extended environment with spatial structure. In addition, the fine\n",
    "centroiding, currently performed using a Gaussian distribution, can be\n",
    "improved by striving for residual minimisation with a master\n",
    "detector-based PSF model. Such a master PSF model will be derived and\n",
    "refined throughout commissioning and Cycle 1 calibration. \n",
