    "In this notebook, we will process a [NIRISS imaging dataset](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-modes/niriss-imaging) through the [JWST calibration pipeline](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline-overview). The example dataset is from [Program ID](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information) 1475 (PI: Boyer, CoI: Volk) which is a sky flat calibration program. NIRCam is used as the primary instrument with NIRISS as a [coordinated parallel instrument](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/methods-and-roadmaps/jwst-parallel-observations/jwst-coordinated-parallels-roadmap). The NIRISS imaging dataset uses a 17-step dither pattern.\n",

These `*_rate.fits` products are 2D (nrows x ncols), averaged over all integrations. 3D countrate data products (`*_rateints.fits`) are also created (nintegrations x nrows x ncols) which have the fitted ramp slopes for each integration.\n",

    "The [pipeline documentation](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/user_documentation/running_pipeline_python.html) discusses how to run the pipeline in the Python Interface, including how to configure pipeline steps and override reference files. By returning the results of the pipeline to a variable, the pipeline returns a datamodel. Note that the [`pipeline.call()` method is preferred over the `pipeline.run()` method](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/user_documentation/running_pipeline_python.html#advanced-use-pipeline-run-vs-pipeline-call).\n",

Note that while the [`persistence` step](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/persistence/description.html) is set to run by default, this step does not automatically correct the science data for persistence. The `persistence` step creates a `*_trapsfilled.fits` file which is a model that records the number of traps filled at each pixel at the end of an exposure. This file would be used as an input to the `persistence` step, via the `input_trapsfilled` argument, to correct a science exposure for persistence. Since persistence is not well calibrated for NIRISS, we do not perform a persistence correction and thus turn off this step to speed up calibration and to not create files that will not be used in the subsequent analysis. This step can be turned off when running the pipeline in Python by doing:\n",

    "The [charge_migration step](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/charge_migration/index.html#charge-migration-step) is particularly important for NIRISS images to mitigate apparent flux loss in resampled images due to the spilling of charge from a central pixel into its neighboring pixels (see [Goudfrooij et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231116301G/abstract) for details). Charge migration occurs when the accumulated charge in a central pixel exceeds a certain signal limit, which is ~25,000 ADU. This step is turned on by default for NIRISS imaging, Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy [(WFSS)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-modes/niriss-wide-field-slitless-spectroscopy), and Aperture Masking Interferometry [(AMI)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-modes/niriss-aperture-masking-interferometry) modes when using CRDS contexts of `jwst_1159.pmap` or later. Different signal limits for each filter are provided by the [pars-chargemigrationstep parameter files](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu). Users can specify a different signal limit by running this step with the `signal_threshold` flag and entering another signal limit in units of ADU.\n",

    "As of CRDS context `jwst_1155.pmap` and later, the [`jump` step](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jwst.jump.JumpStep.html) of the `DETECTOR1` stage of the pipeline will remove residuals associated with [snowballs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/data-artifacts-and-features/snowballs-and-shower-artifacts) for NIRISS imaging, WFSS, and AMI modes. The default parameters for this correction, where `expand_large_events` set to `True` turns on the snowball halo removal algorithm, are specified in the `pars-jumpstep` parameter reference files. Users may wish to alter parameters to optimize removal of snowball residuals. Available parameters are discussed in the [Detection and Flagging of Showers and Snowballs in JWST Technical Report (Regan 2023)](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-008545.pdf)."

    "In the [Image3 stage of the pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_image3.html), the individual `*_cal.fits` files for each of the dither positions are combined to one single distortion corrected image. First, an [Association](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/overview.html) needs to be created to inform the pipeline that these individual exposures are linked together. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `IMAGE3` stage of the pipeline performs the following steps on NIRISS data: \n",
    "- [tweakreg](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/tweakreg/index.html#tweakreg-step) - creates source catalogs of pointlike sources for each input image. The source catalog for each input image is compared to each other to derive coordinate transforms to align the images relative to each other.\n",
    "   - As of CRDS context `jwst_1156.pmap` and later, the `pars-tweakreg` parameter reference file for NIRISS performs an absolute astrometric correction to GAIA data release 3 by default (i.e., the `abs_refcat` parameter is set to `GAIADR3`). Though this default correction generally improves results compared with not doing this alignment, it can sometimes result in poor performance in crowded or sparse fields, so users are encouraged to check astrometric accuracy and revisit this step if necessary.\n",
    "   - As of pipeline version 1.12.5, the default source finding algorithm is `DAOStarFind` which can result in up to 0.5 pix uncertainties in the centroids for undersampled PSFs, like the NIRISS PSFs at short wavelengths [(Goudfrooij 2022)](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/technical-documents/_documents/JWST-STScI-008116.pdf). There are plans to update the default algorithm to `IRAFStarFind` in future pipeline versions.\n",
    "- [skymatch](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/skymatch/index.html#skymatch-step) - measures the background level from the sky to use as input into the subsequent `outlier detection` and `resample` steps.\n",
    "- [outlier detection](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/outlier_detection/index.html#outlier-detection-step) - flags any remaining cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other artifacts not already flagged during the `DETECTOR1` stage of the pipeline, using all input images to create a median image so that outliers in individual images can be identified.\n",
    "- [resample](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/resample/index.html#resample-step) - resamples each input image based on its WCS and distortion information and creates a single undistorted image.\n",
    "- [source catalog](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/source_catalog/index.html#source-catalog-step) - creates a catalog of detected sources along with measured photometries and morphologies (i.e., point-like vs extended). Useful for quicklooks, but optimization is likely needed for specific science cases.\n"
