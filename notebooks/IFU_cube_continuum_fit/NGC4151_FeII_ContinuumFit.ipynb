    "\n",
    "This notebook uses an example 3-D IFU Datacube of the Active Galactic Nucleii NGC 4151 [Storchi-Bergmann et al. 2009,  MNRAS, V 394, pp. 1148-1166](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.394.1148S/abstract).  This is a ground-based AO-fed H-band dataset (1.47-1.87um) from the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) instrument at the Gemini Observatory.  NIFS is a very similar image slicing IFU to JWST NIRSpec.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs some simple spectral investigations.  The notebook utilizes [jdaviz/cubviz](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz) to inspect the dataset and extract 1-D spectra.  The continuum is fit in a region near to the 1.644um [Fe II] emission from the AGN outflow and subtracted.  The centrally compact atomic Hydrogen Brackett 12 feature, which is nearby in wavelength and contaminates the [Fe II] outflow emission, is also fit and removed.  The data sub-cubes of the continuum model and the isolated and continuum subtracted [Fe II] emission are then saved.  These saved data sets will ultimately serve as starting points for the future notebooks in this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook is designed to analyze the 1.6440 [Fe II] emission but the wavelengths can be altered to fit and remove continuum around any emission line of interest.\n",
