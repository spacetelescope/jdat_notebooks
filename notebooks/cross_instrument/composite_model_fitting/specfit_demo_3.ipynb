    "\n",
    "In this example, we are fitting the complex continuum around Lyman-alpha in the spectrum of an active galaxy (NGC 5548). This involves a powerlaw, extinction, emission lines of various widths and absorption lines. Only certain regions of the spectrum (away from strong absorption lines) are fit. The model has some fixed and some free parameters, as well as parameters that are linked together. We are using the Astropy compound-model machinery to add fit all the components simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example makes only partial use of specutils. It reads the data into the Spectrum1D data structure. However, when we get to actually fitting the model, we are just grabbing the numpy arrays (without units, because that caused some errors). "

It is the standard convention to give `label (units)` when labeling axes. The trick used here of adding in the label using `get_label()` and `set_label()` is liable to be too obscure for most users. \n",
