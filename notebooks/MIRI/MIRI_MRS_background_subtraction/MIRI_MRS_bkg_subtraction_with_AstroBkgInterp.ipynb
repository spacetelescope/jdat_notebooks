    "# MIRI MRS Background Subtraction with AstroBkgInterp\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case:** Background estimation and subtraction on Level2 data using dedicated package `AstroBkgInterp` (https://github.com/brynickson/AstroBkgInterp). `AstroBkgInterp` is a Python-based tool that performs flexible and accurate background estimation and subtraction for both 2D images and 3D data cubes. It is designed to address limitations in traditional background methods, particularly in environments where background is spatially structured, the source is embedded in high surface-brightness regions, or no dedicated background frames are available.<br>\n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are critical probes of massive stellar evolution and chemical enrichment in galaxies. However, they are often embedded in crowded or high surface-brightness regions of their host galaxies, where background emission is spatially structured and varies on small angular scales. In such environments, accurate background estimation is essential for isolating the supernova signal and deriving reliable photometry and spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes observations of the Type IIn Supernova 2005ip captured 17 years post-explosion by M, Shahbandeh et al. 2024. For 2005ip, the global thermal background is roughly 10 to 40 times larger than the Supernova (SN) itself, making local background estimation both critical and challenging. Even small variability in the background across the field of view (FOV) can have a potentially significant impact on the source spectrum. This is particularly true at the longer wavelengths, where thermal background tends to dominate, and the intrinsic SN signal is weakest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will use `AstroBkgInterp` to perform accurate, spatially resolved background subtraction tailored to the complex environment of SN 2005ip. First, we will apply its source-masking procedure to exclude the SN flux and replace it with an interpolated estimate of the underlying background. Then, we will use `AstroBkgInterp` to fit a global background model to the masked data and subtract it from the original data. This approach will improve the fidelity of the extracted spectrum, particularly in the background-dominated mid-infrared regime, enabling the detection of faint dust emission features and yielding more robust constraints on the cold dust mass.

    "## Source-Masking Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical feature of `AstroBkgInterp` is its ability to exclude flux from astrophysical sources during the background estimation process. It implements a flexible and configurable source-masking routine that enables users to define regions of interest (typically containing one or more sources) to be excluded from the final background model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user defines the position of the target source, along with an aperture geometry and size; both circular and elliptical apertures are supported. These apertures define the region to be masked and replaced with an interpolated estimate of the underlying background. In polar coordinates centered on the source, the algorithm computes the median flux at each angle from the surrounding annulus and interpolates across the masked region. This directionally informed approach preserves local background structure while excluding contamination from the source itself. To increase robustness and minimize interpolation artifacts, the procedure is repeated in a grid of eight dithered positions surrounding the central source, and the resulting estimates are median-combined to produce the final background.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3D data cubes, `AstroBkgInterp` supports wavelength-dependent masking, allowing for the mask to vary as a function of wavelength. This capability accommodates the variation in PSF size with wavelength, and spectral variations in source morphology, ensuring accurate background estimation across the full spectral range."

    "\n",
    "In order to utilize `AstroBkgInterp`'s source-masking algorithm, we first need to identify the position of the source. Rather than relying solely on the coordinates provided in the image header, we begin by identifying the brightest source in the data cube, which we assume to be the supernova (SN). To accomplish this, we use `DAOStarFinder`, an implementation of the DAOFIND algorithm [Stetson 1987](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S/abstract) designed for point-source detection in astronomical images. DAOFIND locates local maxima in the image that exceed a specified `threshold` (applied to a convolved image) and have a size and shape similar to the defined 2D Gaussian kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: both the detection threshold and maximum seperation allowed between neighboring sources should be adjusted based ont he specific science case (e.g., the number of stars in the field, the degree of crowding, and the expected brightness distribution)."

The result is effectively a \"source replacement\" only, where the background is interpolated locally beneath each masked region without estimating or subtracting a broader background across the image."

    "In addition to localized source masking, `AstroBkgInterp` provides robust background modelling capabilities designed to handle spatially complex astrophysical sources. After masking flux in the user-defined source regions, the tool constructs a background model using one of several configurable fitting methods. These include a fast, one-dimensional row/column median estimator (`bkg_mode = simple`) and a more sophisticated two-dimensional polynomial surface fitting approach (`bkg_mode = polynomial`). The background model is generated from the source-masked image and is is applied on a per-frame basis for 2D images, and on a per-slice basis for 3D data cubes. "

    "For the purpose of this notebook, we will set the `\"polynomial\"` background mode. This mode constructs a background model using a 2D polynomial surface fitting approach implemented in a sliding-window framework. The image is subdivided into a series of overlapping subregions, and a low-order polynomial is independently fit to each region. These fits are then median combined at each pixel location, effectively mitigating the influence of outliers, cosmic rays, and localized noise features. The result is a smooth and robust background model that preserves large-scale background structure while expressing small-scale fluctuations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We set the following parameters to control the behavior and resolution of the polynomial fitting process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `k`: Specifies the degree of the 2D polynomial used for each local fit. Higher values allow for greater flexibility in modeling complex background structure but may increase the risk of overfitting. We adopt the default value of `k = 3`, which provides a good balance between smoothness and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bin_size`: Defines the size of the subregions (windows) over which the local polynomial fitting is performed. Smaller windows capture finer spatial variations but increase computational cost, while larger windows produce smoother fits at the expense of resolving small-scale structure. For this work, we use a bin size of `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cube_resolution`: Controls the spatial sampling and density of polynomial fits across the image. It determines both the number of local fits and the step size between successive fitting regions. We set `cube_resolution = high`, which enforces the finest sampling, yeilding a smoother and more detailed background model at the cost of increased computation time."
