    "# MIRI LRS Slit Spectroscopy: Spectral Extraction using the JWST Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "July 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case:** Spectral extraction of slit spectra with the JWST calibration pipeline.<br>\n",
    "**Data:** Publicly available science data<br>\n",
    "**Tools:** jwst, matplotlib, astropy.<br>\n",
    "**Cross-intrument:** NIRSpec, MIRI.<br>\n",
    "**Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis) and can be [downloaded](https://github.com/spacetelescope/dat_pyinthesky/tree/main/jdat_notebooks/MRS_Mstar_analysis) directly from the [JDAT Notebook Github directory](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks).<br>\n",

    "### Introduction: Spectral extraction in the JWST calibration pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The JWST calibration pipeline performs spectrac extraction for all spectroscopic data using basic default assumptions that are tuned to produce accurately calibrated spectra for the majority of science cases. This default method is a simple fixed-width boxcar extraction, where the spectrum is summed over a number of pixels along the cross-dispersion axis, over the valid wavelength range. An aperture correction is applied at each pixel along the spectrum to account for flux lost from the finite-width aperture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ``extract_1d`` step uses the following inputs for its algorithm:\n",
    "- the spectral extraction reference file: this is a json-formatted file, available as a reference file from the [JWST CRDS system](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu)\n",
    "- the bounding box: the ``assign_wcs`` step attaches a bounding box definition to the data, which defines the region over which a valid calibration is available. We will demonstrate below how to visualize this region. \n",
    "\n",
    "However the ``extract_1d`` step has the capability to perform more complex spectral extractions, requiring some manual editing of parameters and re-running of the pipeline step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to re-run the spectral extraction step with different settings to illustrate the capabilities of the JWST calibration pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate the spectral extraction methods on resampled, calibrated spectral images. The basic demo and two examples run on Level 3 data, in which the nod exposures have been combined into a single spectral image. Two examples will use the Level 2b data - one of the nodded exposures. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is an observation of the Type Ia supernova SN2021aefx, observed by Jha et al in PID 2072 (Obs 1). These data were taken with zero exclusive access period, and published in [Kwok et al 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944L...3K/abstract). You can retrieve the data from [this Box folder](https://stsci.box.com/s/i2xi18jziu1iawpkom0z2r94kvf9n9kb), and we recommend you place the files in the ``data/`` folder of this repository, or change the directory settings in the notebook prior to running. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course use your own data instead of the demo data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### JWST pipeline version and CRDS context\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written using the calibration pipeline version 1.10.2. We set the CRDS context explicitly to 1089 to match the current latest version in MAST. If you use different pipeline versions or CRDS context, please read the relevant release notes ([here for pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst), [here for CRDS](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu)) for possibly relevant changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "For non-standard cases or slitless LRS data it is however possible to subtract a background as part of the spectral extraction in ``extract_1d``. In the ``extract_1d`` reference file we can pass specific parameters for the background:\n",

    "* bkg_fit (string): the type or method of the background computation. (e.g. None, 'poly', 'mean' or 'median')\n",
    "* bkg_order (int): the order of polynomial to fit to background regions. if bkg_fit is not set to 'poly', this parameter will be ignored. \n",
    "* smoothing_length (odd int; optional): the width of the boxcar filter that will be used to smooth the background signal in the dispersion direction. This can provide a better quality in case of noisy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'poly' option for the ``bkg_fit`` parameter will take the value of all pixels in the background region on a given row, and fit a polynomial of order ``bkg_order`` to them. This option can be useful in cases where a gradient is present in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we're using here already has the background subtracted so we expect the impact of this to be minimal, but we provide a demonstration using the nod 1, level 2b spectral image. In this example we will calculate the background from 2 4-column windows, setting the ``bkg_fit`` to 'median'. \n",
