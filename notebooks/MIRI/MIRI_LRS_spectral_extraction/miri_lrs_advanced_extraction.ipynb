    "# MIRI LRS Slit Spectroscopy: Spectral Extraction using the JWST Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** Sarah Kendrew, Ian Wong; MIRI branch<br>\n",
    "**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025<br>\n",
    "**Pipeline Version:** 1.20.2 (Build 12.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** <br>\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate the custom spectral extraction capabilities of the JWST calibration pipeline. The JWST calibration pipeline performs spectral extraction for all spectroscopic data using a set of basic default assumptions that are tuned to produce accurately calibrated spectra for the majority of science cases. In the case of MIRI LRS data obtained in the slit, the default method is a simple 8-pixel-wide boxcar extraction, where the spectrum is summed along the cross-dispersion axis over the valid wavelength range. An aperture correction is applied at each wavelength element along the spectrum to account for flux lost from the finite-width aperture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ``extract_1d`` step uses the following inputs for its algorithm:\n",
    "- the spectral extraction reference file: this is a json-formatted file, available as a reference file from the [JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS)](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu)\n",
    "- the bounding box: the ``assign_wcs`` step attaches a bounding box definition to the data, which defines the region over which a valid calibration is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simple boxcar extraction, the ``extract_1d`` step has the capability to perform more complex spectral extractions, which require the user to manually edit some of the parameters contained in the spectral extraction reference file and rerun the pipeline step. Of particular note is the ability to perform optimal spectral extraction, which can be activated using the newly added ``extraction_type`` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** <br>\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is an observation of the Type Ia supernova SN2021aefx, observed by Jha et al. in Program #2072 (Observation 1). These data were taken with zero exclusive access period and published in [Kwok et al 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944L...3K/abstract). The relevant data files are located in the compressed ``data.zip`` file and will be automatically unpacked and placed in a subdirectory called ``data/``. The user can also manually specify a particular set of input files of their choice below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate most of the spectral extraction methods on resampled, calibrated spectral images (``s2d`` files). The basic demo and many examples run on Level 3 data, in which the pair of nodded exposures has been combined into a single spectral image. Several of the other examples use a Level 2b data file, corresponding to just the first of the two nodded exposures. For optimal spectral extraction (Example 5), the pipeline requires unrectified, calibrated spectral images (``cal`` files).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**JWST pipeline version and CRDS context:** <br>\n",
    "This notebook was written for the above-specified pipeline version and associated build context for this version of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. Information about this and other contexts can be found in the JWST CRDS [server](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/). If you use different pipeline versions, please refer to the [build context table](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/) to determine what context to use. To learn more about the differences for the pipeline, read the relevant [documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/jwst-operations-pipeline-build-information#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that pipeline software development is a continuous process, so results in some cases may be slightly different if a subsequent version is used. **For optimal results, users are strongly encouraged to reprocess their data using the most recent pipeline version and [associated CRDS context](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/display_build_contexts/), taking advantage of bug fixes and algorithm improvements.** Any [known issues](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/known-issues-with-jwst-data#gsc.tab=0) for this build are noted in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation:** <br>\n",

    "The data subdirectory also contains two different versions of the Level 2 ``s2d`` file for the first nodded exposure. Both of them are resampled and rectified spectral images produced by the second stage of the calibration pipeline. The default file ``l2_s2d_file`` follows the standard pipeline procedure of pairwise nod subtraction and shows a single pair of positive and negative traces. The ``l2_s2d_file_nobsub`` file was custom generated with the background subtraction step skipped and therefore only contains a positive trace. For a general overview of custom pipeline processing, refer to the [MIRI LRS Slit Mode Pipeline Notebook](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst-pipeline-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/MIRI/LRS-slit/JWPipeNB-MIRI-LRS-slit.ipynb). The choice to skip nod subtraction may be motivated by the presence of additional sources within the slit or an extended target. The ``extract_1d`` step provides flexible options for customized background subtraction for instances where simple mutual subtraction of the nodded exposures is not appropriate."

    "\n",
    "* ``id``: identification label that specifies the exposure type (slit vs. slitless) the parameters will be applied to.\n",
    "* ``region_type``: optional; if included, it must be set to 'target'.\n",
    "* ``disp_axis``: defines the direction of the dispersion (1 for x-axis, 2 for y-axis). **For MIRI LRS this should always be set to 2.**\n",
    "* ``xstart`` (int or float): first pixel of the extraction aperture in the horizontal direction (0-indexed).\n",
    "* ``xstop`` (int or float): last pixel of the extraction aperture in the horizontal direction (0-indexed; the limit is **inclusive**).\n",
    "* ``ystart`` (int or float): first pixel of the extraction aperture in the vertical direction (0-indexed).\n",
    "* ``ystop`` (int or float): last pixel of the extraction aperture in the vertical direction (0-indexed; the limit is **inclusive**).\n",
    "* ``extract_width`` (int or float): width of extraction aperture in the cross-dispersion direction. This parameter takes precedence over the ``xstart`` and ``xstop`` settings. If both are given, the ``xstart`` and ``xstop`` positions are used to determine the location of the spectral trace, but the spectral extraction utilizes an aperture of width equal to ``extract_width``.\n",
    "* ``bkg_fit``: the type of background fit or computation used; can be 'median', 'mean', or 'poly' (polynomial fitting).\n",
    "* ``bkg_order``: if ``bkg_fit`` is set to 'poly', this is the polynomial order to be used for background fitting; if the accompanying parameter ``bkg_coeff`` is not provided, no background fitting will be performed. **For MIRI LRS slit data, default background subtraction is achieved in the Spec2Pipeline by mutually subtracting the nodded expsosures, so the basic use case does not require additional background subtraction from the spectral images.**\n",
    "* ``bkg_coeff``: polynomial coefficients for defining background extraction region limits (list of lists of float); single-entry lists are interpreted as vertical boundaries.\n",
    "* ``src_coeff``: polynomial coefficients for the source extraction region limits (list of lists of float); this setting takes precedence over the start/stop values if both are provided.\n",

This approach is optimized for point sources, and the current flux calibration of the JWST pipeline is benchmarked to yield the correct flux level when using this method.\n",

    "Having chosen the desired background region, we use the ``bkg_coeff`` parameter to pass our selection to the ``extract_1d`` step. It is important to note that the pixel coordinate convention in ``bkg_coeff`` is somewhat different than for ``xstart`` and ``xstop``. For typical use cases, ``xstart`` and ``xstop`` are integers, which correspond to the whole pixels on the detector, i.e., the aperture boundary extends from the left edge of the ``xstart`` pixel to the right edge of the ``xstop`` pixel. In contrast, ``bkg_coeff`` assumes exact pixel coordinates, where a whole number pixel value cooresponds to the geometric center of that pixel on the detector. Therefore, in order to include the full pixels within the two column ranges defined above, we must use the pixel boundary coordinates 0.5, 6.5, 20.5, and 26.5. \n",

    "The two spectra are largely comparable. It is important to recall that the current photometric calibration of the LRS slit is based on nod-subtracted Level 3 products. At the longest wavelengths, where the PSF of the spectral trace broadens considerably, there is nonnegligible overlap between the two nodded spectral profiles. In other words, when carrying out the nod subtraction, some fraction of the target flux in Nod 2 is removed from the Nod 1 spectrum, and vice versa. The aperture correction accounts for this during standard pipeline processing. However, when producing custom spectra from ``s2d`` files without nod subtraction, there will be some bias in the overall flux level of the extracted spectra due to the discrepant processing workflows. Users that require accurate absolute flux measurements should therefore recalibrate the flux levels by extracting the spectra of standard stars using an analogous methodology and comparing them to stellar model spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the figure, we can see that the background level rises steeply at long wavelengths, consistent with our earlier inspection of the spectral image. We also note some significant jitter at long wavelengths, likely due to bad pixels and generally poorer SNR. It may be helpful to smooth the background model to lessen the impact of these pixel-to-pixel variations while preserving the overall trend with wavelength. This can be accomplished by using the ``smoothing_length`` parameter, which provides the width of the boxcar kernel used for smoothing the background regions along the dispersion direction; the parameter must be an odd integer."

    "As of Version 1.18.0 of the JWST calibration pipeline, the ``extract_1d`` step allows for optimal spectral extraction. A finely sampled empirical PSF model of the LRS slit spectral trace is available in CRDS and is based on high SNR observations of relatively bright point sources. Together with a spectral trace information provided in the file header, the extraction step generates a normalized PSF model for each row, which is then fit to the measured pixel values to yield the calculated flux. Because the empirical PSF in principle encapsulates the full dispersed flux of a point source at each wavelength, no aperture correction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages of optimal spectral extraction. First, the input spectral image need not be rectified, as the algorithm leverages the spectral trace profile stored in the file header to align the PSF model in each row; this allows the user to avoid any interpolation artifacts that stem from the rectification process required to generate ``s2d`` files. Second, optimal spectral extraction is far more robust to missing data (e.g., bad pixels), cosmic rays, and point-to-point scatter and generally produces higher SNR spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the optimal spectral extraction option in ``extract_1d`` only allows for unrectified spectral images of the full detector (i.e., ``cal`` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal spectral extraction typically does not utilize the aperture and background subtraction information contained within the ``extract_1d`` reference file. Instead, control over the extraction process is handled directly via parameter settings that must be passed directly to the ``extract_1d`` call. Let's examine the relevant parameter settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``extraction_type``: this is the crucial toggle that instructs the ``extract_1d`` algorithm to carry out optimal spectral extraction; 'box' is the default setting, which we implicitly used for all of the other examples in this notebook.\n",
    "* ``use_source_posn`` (True/False/None): setting this to True is recommended, which allows the pipeline to carry out a first-order adjustment of the PSF model to align it with the expected location of the target along the slit; this setting has the same function as the analogous one contained in the ``extract_1d`` reference file.\n",
    "* ``model_nod_pair`` (True/False): must be set to True if the ``s2d`` file contains a negative trace to instruct the algorithm to model all positive and negative traces using the same empirical PSF model.\n",
    "* ``optimize_psf_location`` (True/False): setting this to True is strongly recommended, given inherent uncertainties in target location and pointing accuracy. When this option is set to True, the location of the positive and negative traces (if used) are optimized with respect to the residuals of the scene modeled by the PSF at that location.
