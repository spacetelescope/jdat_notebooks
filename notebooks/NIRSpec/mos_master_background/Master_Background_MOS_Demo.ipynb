    "JWST observations detect background emission from various sources: the zodiacal cloud, Milky Way Galaxy, thermal self-emission from the observatory itself, and stray light from out-of-field sky ([JDocs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-general-support/jwst-background-model)). To remove this unwanted excess signal from the spectral traces of science targets, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) [JWST Calibration Pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides two standard background subtraction methods for NIRSpec MOS observations, one of which is called \"master background\" subtraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Master background subtraction is a technique implemented by the *[`MasterBackgroundMosStep`](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jwst.master_background.MasterBackgroundMosStep.html#jwst.master_background.MasterBackgroundMosStep)* in the *[`calwebb_spec2`](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html)* pipeline for MOS mode observations. This removal strategy relies on an independent, flux-calibrated 1-D master background spectrum, which can be provided directly by the user or generated on the fly with background data from predefined sky pixels ([Alves de Oliveira et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06922)). For MOS observations, these come from designated background MSA slitlets (\"blank sky\" shutters assigned in the MSA configuration) within the same exposure as the science targets. The detailed list of operations performed when applying master background subtraction to MOS data during *[`calwebb_spec2`](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html)* processing is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Process all slitlets in the MOS exposure up through the [*`extract_2d`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/extract_2d/index.html) and [*`srctype`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/srctype/index.html) steps (includes: [*`assign_wcs`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/assign_wcs/main.html), [*`imprint`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/imprint/index.html), [*`msa_flagging`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/msaflagopen/index.html), and optionally [*`nsclean`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/nsclean/index.html#nsclean-step)).\n",
    "2. The [*`MasterBackgroundMosStep`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jwst.master_background.MasterBackgroundMosStep.html#jwst.master_background.MasterBackgroundMosStep) step temporarily applies remaining calibration steps up through [*`photom`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/photom/index.html) to all slits, treating them all as extended sources (appropriate for background signal), and saving the extended source correction arrays for each slit in an internal copy of the data model (includes: [*`flat_field`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/flatfield/index.html#flatfield-step), [*`barshadow`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/barshadow/index.html), [*`wavecorr`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/wavecorr/index.html), [*`pathloss`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pathloss/index.html)).\n",
    "3. <a id='step3'></a> If a user-supplied master background spectrum is not given, the [*`resample_spec`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/resample/index.html) and [*`extract_1d`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/extract_1d/index.html) steps are applied to the calibrated background slits, resulting in extracted 1-D background spectra.\n",
    "4. The 1-D background spectra are combined, using the [*`combine_1d`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/combine_1d/index.html) step, into a master background spectrum.\n",
    "5. If a user-supplied master background is given, steps 3 and 4 are skipped and the user-supplied spectrum is inserted into the processing flow.\n",
    "6. The master background spectrum (either user-supplied or created on-the-fly) is expanded into the 2-D space of each slit.\n",
    "7. The 2-D background “image” for each slit is processed in **inverse** mode through the [*`photom`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/photom/index.html), [*`barshadow`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/barshadow/index.html), [*`pathloss`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pathloss/index.html), and [*`flat_field`*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/flatfield/index.html#flatfield-step) steps, using the correction arrays that were computed in step 2, so that the background data now matches the partially calibrated background signal in each slit.\n",
    "8. The corrected 2-D background is subtracted from each open slitlet.\n",
    "9. The background-subtracted slits are processed through all remaining *`calwebb_spec2`* calibration steps, using the corrections appropriate for the source type in each slit.\n",

The range of wavelengths lost in the gap is different for different shutters in the MSA since the spectra from different shutters map to different locations on the detectors. Unlike fixed slits (FS) and integral field unit (IFU) observations, which suffer wavelength gap losses only in the R ~ 2,700 high spectral resolution mode, all grating and filter combinations for MOS observations have shutters that lose wavelengths to the gap.

    "The following section demonstrates one method for identifying unmasked hot/bad pixels and modifying their corresponding DQ flag to \"DO_NOT_USE\" using the imported `manually_define_dq_flags` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function works best with the Python package Plotly for interactive plotting. Installation instructions for Plotly are [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py). Plotly generates an interactive plot that allows users to easily hover over hot/bad pixels and obtain their location information (x,y). If Plotly is not installed, a static plot will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing a list of coordinates and setting the parameter `update_dq` to True, the `manually_define_dq_flags` function will modify the DQ flags in the countrate file (*_rate.fits*) for those pixels to \"DO_NOT_USE\". This flag ensures that identified hot/bad pixels are excluded when extracting 1-D spectra. To confirm the successful implementation of the modifications, rerun *`calwebb_spec2`* in [Section 7](#masterbkg) and utilize the `plot_spectra` function to visualize the resulting spectra."
