    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The JWST pipeline produces 1-D and 2-D rectified spectra from combined exposures for each spectroscopic mode. Currently, the 1D products are produced using aperture extraction, with plans to implement optimal extraction via PSF-weighting or fitting. However, there are many situations in which the output will not necessarily be \"optimal\", and fine-tuning the parameters will be needed to improve the results. This notebook is intended to provide a walkthrough of the optimal extraction procedure with example JWST data.\n",

While we could shift and trim to the correct size, the spectrum will rarely be centered on a pixel, and is sufficiently under-sampled that fractional pixel shifts in the PSF could cause significant errors in the final extraction. Thus, we will perform a final resampling to the location of the spectrum in the extraction region. To do this, we can use our old friend `RegularGridInterpolator`. We set the center of the WebbPSF trace (originally at row 23) to our fit trace center, and resample appropriately."
