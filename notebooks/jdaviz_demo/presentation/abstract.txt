Jdaviz: the JWST data analysis and visualization software

Jdaviz is a package to visualize and analyze astronomical images and spectra. 
It is written in Python, it is open source, and it is fully maintained. 
It was initially designed for JWST data, but can work with datasets from other facilities as well. 
Jdaviz comes with 5 predefined configurations: Imviz for imaging, Specviz for 1D spectra, 
Specviz2d for 2D/1D spectra, Cubeviz for cube data, and Mosviz to quicklook many spectra. 
In this talk, I will show you what Jdaviz is and what use cases it supports. 
I will also demonstrate how to use it and, if you like, you can join with your machine 
and try on your side too. 

Installation instructions can be found here: https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html.
