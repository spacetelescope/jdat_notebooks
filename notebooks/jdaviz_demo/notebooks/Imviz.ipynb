    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate an example workflow to show of some key features of [Imviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imviz/index.html). We will be looking at some basic functionality (starting the app in a notebook, loading data, pan/zoom, subsets/regions of interest) as well as some of the higher level plugin tools including catalog search and aperture photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting Imviz and loading data (NGC 346, star forming region).\n",
    "2. Setting display options for loaded data.\n",
    "3. Aligning images by pixel / wcs. Blinking between loaded images. \n",
    "4. Loading GAIA catalog and plotting sources on images. Zooming and panning on image.\n",
    "5. Drawing and recentering a subset.\n",
    "6. Aperture photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demo will demonstrate how to do these tasks in the application UI, but this notebook has API calls to do the same steps programatically. (That is the magic of jdaviz!)\n",
