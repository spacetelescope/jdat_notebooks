    "# Draft: Imaging Sky Background Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides some tips on estimating the sky background for relatively complex scenes. It also demonstrates ways to evaluate the quality of this sky estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sky estimation is one of the tricker aspects of image processing. This is in part because the \"sky\" is part of the astronomical scene. Some of what is considered background may be in the foreground (thermal background in the detector, scattered light, or zodiacal light). Sometimes the objects of interest overlap (galaxies in front of other galaxies). This notebook does not address the \"de-blending\" problem of overlapping galaxies, but does outline some of the techniques for dealing with large-scale patterns in the sky. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Photutils manual has an extensive discussion of [background estimation](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/background.html), which is the basis for much of what is in this notebook."
