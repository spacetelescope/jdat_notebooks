Each PA range should be entered as a separate Special Requirement. For example, using the 20% threshold, the first Special Requirement for the example observation above would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Aperture PA Range 359.92542306 to 80.92542306 Degrees (V3 0.0 to 81.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the tool does not take into account target visibility, so some of the PA ranges shown may not need to be considered. For example, if a strong claw is predicted at a PA that is never available in the [roll analysis](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-astronomers-proposal-tool-overview/apt-workflow-articles/apt-visit-planner#gsc.tab=0), users don't have to include Special Requirements to avoid that PA as it will never be used anyway. To check which PA ranges are actually available for a given visit, users can go to `Visit Planner→Reports→Visitx.x→Total Roll Analysis For Visit`."
